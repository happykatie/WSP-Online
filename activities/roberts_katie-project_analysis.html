				<hr />
					<p>The website re-design goals of the City of Okeechobee are to reorganize and condense the current content, and refocus the content to the interests of the residents of Okeechobee. Condensing the website navigation down to 6 menu items, instead of the current 15, will simplify the user experience by helping them locate what what they are looking for faster. The overall look of the site is confusing. There are excess links, including external links in the navigation menu that need to be reorganized under one menu item. The content is heavily focused towards the interests of the government officials, instead of addressing the interests of the community. To reach the target audience and increase web traffic, most of the current content can be placed under a "Government" section, making room to focus on the members of the community and community events. The visual flow can be improved by adjusting the layout to include web-optimized images and visual hierarchy to the text. </p>
					<p>By organizing and reducing the current content, as well as adding content that engages the community, the navigation can be reduced to the following 6 pages:
						<ul>
							<li>Home</li>
							<li>Events</li>
							<li>Community</li>
							<li>Government</li>
							<li>Departments</li>
							<li>Contacts</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>To further suit the needs of the community and increase web traffic, links to register for online utility billing and to pay bills, such as water and trash collection, should be present on the home page for easy access. By adding a bill pay option that would likely be utilized monthly, and shifting to a community focus, the site traffic will increase.</p>

					<h3>Overview:</h3>
					<p>After my research of the demographic data, I will focus on two user personas for cityofokeechobee.com's target audience. The first is a male, age 45-54 who travels from another town to go fishing at Lake Okeechobee. The second is female, age 25-34, who has two young children and lives locally.</p>

						</ul>
					Bill works 5 days a week at his mower store in Arcadia, FL, with his wife Beth and middle daughter Stephanie. He enjoys small talk with local ranchers and customers who come by for parts and service. He owns a 2004 Dodge Ram pick-up and and a bass boat, and his hobbies include fishing, and hunting turkey, deer and wild hogs. Bill enjoys his family, but often takes the weekends to meet up with his friends in Okeechobee to go fishing on the lake for "guy time". He has an appreciation for his small town, and the other small towns around it. He always makes a point to stop by one of his 2-3 favorite locally-owned restaurants in Okeechobee. With his oldest daughter in college, money is tight. Lately, he has occasionally been taking his wife and two youngest daughters with him to Okeechobee. He accesses the internet from his home desktop computer before he leaves for Okeechobee, to check the lake level, the weather, and top local news stories.

She doesn't like to spend a lot of time cleaning and bill-paying, and on her days off she likes to take at least one day to enjoy family time at the beach in Jupiter or Tampa. She doesn't want to put too many miles on her car since she can't afford a costly repairs, and has been looking for some local activities for her family.
